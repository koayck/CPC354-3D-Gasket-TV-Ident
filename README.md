# CPC354-3D-Gasket-TV-Ident

# Introduction

This project is a 3D gasket animation of a TV ident for the course CPC354 Computer Graphics & Visualization. The program is written in JavaScript and uses WebGL for rendering.

# Objective

The objective of this project is to create a 3D gasket animation of a TV ident that can be controlled by the user. The program should be able to rotate the gasket, change the number of subdivisions, and change the colors of the gasket.
