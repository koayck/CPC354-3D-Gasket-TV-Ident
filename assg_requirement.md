Specifications:

You are to study the 3D gasket program in Angel Section 2.10.10 (7th Edition) (appended). You are to run and then extend the program given in Angelâ€™s Website (see the URL below and also appended) as much as possible as specified below.

http://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SEVENTH_EDITION/CODE/02 

refer to gasket4.js and gasket4.html


Based on the given program, you are to write a program to create an animation that is regarded as a TV Ident (an animated logo which shows branding of a TV channel). Your TV ident must be based on the 3D gasket from Angel as described above. Among the things that you have to perform include:

(i)    Animation of the TV ident: The 3D Gasket has firstly to be rotated at the centre of the window to the right 180 degrees and then back to its original orientation. It is then rotated to the left 180 degrees and back to its original orientation. The gasket is then gradually enlarged to an appropriate size. The gasket will then be moved about until a button is pressed (put it in a loop).

(ii)    Design a dialogue with good user interface to input various appropriate parameters (e.g. number of subdivisions/iterations, speed of animation), attributes (e.g. colours) before performing the animation. Make use of button, menu, slider, keydown event, window events etc.

(iii)   Write a structured program with good style and extend the functionalities of your program.


You are required to submit a report (with no page limit; 1.5 Line Spacing; Arial 11; Normal Margin). Your report should contain

Describe the detailed works of your team member. (3 marks) expected page - 1

Introduction: explain what is "TV Ident" in regards to Computer Graphics and Visualisation. (5 marks) - expected page > 2

Literature Review: Provide several reviews on the progress of TV ident since the beginning of the advent of Computer Graphics until its usage in Broadcasting of television. Please provide with references and citations (25marks) - expected page >2

Proposed method: Detail description of your technique/functions (using appropriate diagrams and mathematical equations), you are required to include diagrams and each diagram need detail explanation. (25 marks) - expected page - >2

Make sure the objectives are followed: 

i. Animation of the TV ident: The 3D Gasket has firstly to be rotated at the centre of the window to the right 180 degrees and then back to its original orientation. It is then rotated to the left 180 degrees and back to its original orientation. The gasket is then gradually enlarged to an appropriate size. The gasket will then be moved about until a button is pressed (put it in a loop) - (10 marks)

ii. Design a dialogue with good user interface to input various appropriate parameters (e.g. number of subdivisions/iterations, speed of animation), attributes (e.g. colours) before performing the animation. Make use of button, menu, slider, keydown event, window events etc. - (10 marks)

iii. Write a structured program with good style and extend the functionalities of your program. (10 marks)

Conclusion: Summarised your method and explain why the reason for (failing) or (success) in displaying shapes, colours and animation of the 3D gasket for TV Ident (10 marks) - expected page >1
